Such payments shall continue to be an obligation of the property owner and shall be reimbursed by the property owner to the County. The County may consider making such payments in its own discretion or if a tenant household makes a written request to the Department following a property owner's failure to pay the required payments within the period mandated under section 3.108.060, but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the tenant household's vacation of the dwelling or room. Prior to any County payment to a tenant household, the Director shall make a determination regarding the eligibility of the tenant household for relocation payments. The Department will make reasonable efforts to contact a representative of the property owner prior to making the determination or authorizing the County's payment. However, failure to give prior notice to the property owner shall not relieve the property owner of any obligations under <cite path="3.108">this chapter</cite>.</text>

The County Manager, in consultation with the County Counsel, shall have the discretion to reduce the amount of any required reimbursement from a property owner to the County in cases where the factual and legal circumstances warrant such a reduction. The property owner shall reimburse the County within five (5) days of receipt of billing from the County. If the property owner does not make full and timely payment to the County, the County is entitled to recover an additional amount equal to the sum of one-half the amount paid by the County on the property owner's behalf, but not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), as a penalty for failure to make timely payment. The County may also record a lien on the subject property with the County Recorder and shall provide notice of such lien to the property owner and to the County Assessor. The form of such lien and the manner of enforcement and collection shall be as authorized by state or local law. Alternatively, the County may include the unreimbursed amount in any other lien placed on the property by the County to secure payment of enforcement costs. Notwithstanding the above, the intent of <cite path="3.108">this chapter</cite> is to place primary responsibility for making relocation payments to displaced tenant households on those property owners who are responsible for code violations, and nothing in this section is intended to relieve or release any such property owner from this responsibility.</text>
