        <text>Requirements. An annual license fee shall be paid for every dog or cat over the age of four (4) months owned or harbored in unincorporated San Mateo County. Said annual license fee shall be first due when the animal reaches four (4) months of age or within 60 days after the dog or cat is acquired, and due on the anniversary date of the original purchase date each year thereafter. New residents shall have sixty (60) days in which to acquire such license. Persons renewing their license shall have thirty (30) days following their due date before being delinquent and having to pay a late penalty. The fee for such license shall be as set forth in <cite path="6.04.290" proof="needed">section 6.04.290</cite>. The fee paid for the licensing of spayed or neutered dogs and cats shall be less than said license fee for unaltered cats or dogs upon presentation of the proper certification. The license fee paid by persons over the age of 60 shall be at a discount. For purposes of this section any surcharge on the license fee imposed under <cite path="6.04.290" proof="needed">section 6.04.290</cite> shall not be considered part of the license fee. Any person who shall fail to pay such license fee after said fee is due, or said dog or cat is required to be licensed, shall in addition to paying any past due license fee or fees, also pay a penalty in accordance with <cite path="6.04.290" proof="needed">section 6.04.290</cite>.

Dog or cat licenses are not transferable between owners; however, if the dog or cat dies and the owner acquires a new dog or cat, the license is transferable to the new dog or cat. The license does not have to be renewed until the original purchase anniversary date. The fee paid for a dog or cat license is not refundable.</text>

      <text>No person shall own or keep any exotic animal without first applying to and receiving from the Planning and Building Department a use permit to do so. Section 6315(u) San Mateo County Ordinance Code, Zoning Annex.</text>
      <text>The application for a Health System permit shall contain the name of the applicant, his address, the address of the proposed location of the exotic animal, (if different from the applicant's) and a brief description of the applicant's plan for keeping the exotic animal which shall include the species of animal, the number of individuals of each species and a description of the housing facilities, for the exotic animal, and the reason for the keeping of such animal.</text>
      <text>Health System Permit fees for keeping of exotic animals shall be established by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. The initial Health System fee shall be a filing fee for the issuance of each Health System permit. Each permit shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of issuance unless revoked or suspended. The fee may cover either one exotic animal or a collection, and the maximum number of specimens permitted to be kept shall be specified in the permit. Whenever a new exotic animal or collection is added so as to exceed the maximum number permitted, a new Health System permit must be secured and a new fee shall be due and payable at the time of issuance of the permit.</text>
      <text>Whenever, in any given Health System permit year, there are new exotic animals in a collection due to the reproduction of members of the collection or due to trade, exchange, or replacement in the same number and of the same zoological order as the members of the collection traded, exchanged or replaced, the new exotic animals do not require an additional permit during that year, provided the Director is notified in writing of the new exotic animals within thirty days of acquisition.</text>
