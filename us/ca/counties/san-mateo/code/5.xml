      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>In enacting <cite path="5.44">this chapter</cite>, the Board of Supervisors recognizes that commercial massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable health and therapeutic services. The Board of Supervisors further recognizes that, unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of <cite path="5.44">this chapter</cite> to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of <cite path="5.44">this chapter</cite> to address the negative impacts identified in the Board of Supervisor's findings to reduce or prevent neighborhood blight and to protect and preserve the quality of the County neighborhoods and commercial districts; and to enhance enforcement of criminal statutes relating to the conduct of operators and employees of massage businesses.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>It is the Board's further purpose and intent to rely upon the uniform statewide regulations applicable to massage practitioners and establishments that were enacted by the State Legislature in 2008 as Business and Professions Code Sections 4600 et seq. by Senate Bill 731, and amended in 2011 by Assembly Bill 619, to restrict the commercial practice of massage in the unincorporated areas of San Mateo County to those persons duly certified to practice by the California Massage Therapy Council, and to provide for the registration and regulation of massage businesses for health and safety purposes to the extent allowed by law.</text>

      <heading>Inspection fees.</heading>
      <text>Inspection fees shall be assessed to operators of solid waste facilities in equal quarterly installments. Said fees shall be computed by dividing the adjusted weight of solid waste handled at the facility during the preceding fiscal year by the total adjusted weight handled at all solid waste facilities in the County during such year. Such quotient shall then be multiplied by the total projected cost of the County Solid Waste Management Enforcement Program during the current fiscal year to obtain the fee for the facility. Each quarterly installment of said fee shall be payable within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the invoice of said installment.</text>

      <heading>Purpose and implementation.</heading>
      <text>It is the purpose of <cite path="5.104">this chapter</cite> to implement the provisions of the California Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 (Public Utilities Code Section 5800 et seq., "DIVCA") and the rules promulgated thereunder by the California Public Utilities Commission as they apply to a "local franchising entity" or a "local entity" as defined under DIVCA in Sections 5830(h) and 5830(k) of the California Public Utilities Code, respectively within the unincorporated areas of San Mateo County (County). Consistent with that purpose, the provisions of <cite path="5.104">this chapter</cite> are to be construed in a manner consistent with DIVCA and the applicable rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated thereunder.</text>
      <text>On January 1, 2007, the State of California became the sole authority with power to grant state video franchises pursuant to the DIVCA under the California Public Utilities Commission final rulemaking decision dated March 1, 2007. Pursuant to DIVCA, the County shall receive a franchise fee and a fee for public, educational and/or government (PEG) purposes from all state video franchise holders operating within County. Additionally, the County acquired the responsibility to establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise holders operating within the County for violations of customer service standards pursuant to DIVCA. DIVCA leaves unchanged the County's franchise agreements with Comcast and Open Video Service Agreements with Astound Broadband to operate in the County, until those agreements expire.</text>

In the event that any person is denied a permit, or shall have his permit revoked by the Sheriff, an appeal may be taken to the Board of Supervisors within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of notice of said denial or revocation. If such an appeal is taken it shall be by written notice of appeal, filed with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors and served upon the Sheriff by the Applicant or permittee. Said notice shall state the facts required to be stated in the Applicant's original Application. The Board of Supervisors shall set a day for hearing the said appeal and shall designate the time and place where such hearing is to be held. A notice of said hearing shall be given the said Applicant or permittee by the Clerk of the said Board of Supervisors by mailing the same to the last known address of said Applicant or permittee not less than five (5) days prior to the date set for said hearing.</text>
      <text>At any such hearing the Applicant or permittee shall be given the opportunity to be heard and/or defend himself, and may call witnesses and present evidence in his behalf. The Sheriff, or his representative, shall attend the said hearing. Upon conclusion of such hearing the Board of Supervisors shall sustain or overrule, by majority vote, the decision of the Sheriff.</text>
      <text>The holder of an operator's License may interchange electronic amusement devices without prior approval of the Sheriff's office. The operator's License shall clearly state the maximum number of electronic amusement devices to be operated under the authority of that License.</text>
      <text>Misuse or manipulation of the interchangeability paragraph of this section will be grounds for revocation of an operator's License. Misuse is the operation of more electronic amusement devices than covered by the operator's License.</text>

      <heading>Purpose.</heading>
      <text>The Surgeon General of the United States has advised women who are pregnant, or considering pregnancy, not to drink alcoholic beverages. Recent research indicates that alcohol consumption during pregnancy, especially in the early months, can harm the fetus, and result in birth defects including mental retardation, facial abnormalities and other defects involving heart and bone structure. In order to serve the public health, safety, and welfare, the purpose of <cite path="5.128">this chapter</cite> is to educate the public by requiring warning signs to be placed at all locations where alcoholic beverages are sold to the public.</text>

In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make Application in writing to the Tax Collector for a hearing on the amount assessed. If Application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Collector shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such Application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.

Such operator may, within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make Application in writing to the Tax Collector for a hearing on the amount assessed. If Application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Collector shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such Application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five (5) days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 5.150.090.</text>

      <text>The Change of Use Permit shall expire one (1) year from the date of its approval, unless the Applicant requests an extension setting forth satisfactory reasons for not proceeding within the one-year period. The Community Development Director may grant no more than two (2) such extensions of one year each, based upon a showing that good faith progress has been made toward fulfilling the conditions of approval, or some intervening event not the fault of the park owner has prevented timely compliance with the conditions of approval. An Application must be filed with the Department no less than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the Change of Use Permit or any extension. If relocation assistance has not been provided to all eligible residents in accordance with <cite path="5.156">this chapter</cite> within three (3) years of the original date of permit approval, a new relocation impact report and Application shall be required in accordance with <cite path="5.156">this chapter</cite>. Each year on the anniversary date of the permit approval, the relocation assistance shall be increased by an amount equivalent to the increase in the cost-of-living index for the Oakland/San Francisco area published by the U.S. Department of Labor. The index shall be for the quarterly period closest to the anniversary date of the permit.</text>

      <heading>Conversion through vacancy.</heading>
      <text>Whenever twenty five percent (25%) or more of the total number of mobilehome sites within a mobilehome park are uninhabited for more than ninety (90) consecutive days, and such condition was not caused by a natural or physical disaster beyond the control of the mobilehome park owner, then such condition shall be deemed a "mobilehome park closure" for the purposes of this ordinance. The mobilehome park owner shall file an Application for change of use within a reasonable amount of time as determined by the Director, in compliance with <cite path="5.156">this chapter</cite>. A mobilehome site is considered to be "uninhabited" when no rent is being paid for use of the site and it is either (i) unoccupied by a mobilehome or (ii) occupied by a mobilehome in which no person resides.</text>
      <text>A mobilehome resident or other interested party who believes that 25% or more of the total number of mobilehome sites within a mobilehome park are uninhabited may file a written statement to that effect with the Community Development Director. The Director or his or her designee shall investigate and determine whether an unpermitted change of use of a mobilehome park has occurred. Once the Director makes such determination, a written notice that describes such determination shall be sent by the County to the mobilehome park owner, mobilehome park manager, and the person who filed the written statement.</text>

      <heading>Exemption from relocation assistance requirements.</heading>
      <text>Any person who files an Application for a Change of Use Permit may, simultaneous with and as part of the filing of such Application, request an exemption from some or all of the relocation assistance requirements described in this <cite path="5.15">chapter 5.15</cite>6. The request shall be processed in conjunction with the Application for the permit, and shall be distributed to each eligible resident household and mobilehome owner at the time of Application submittal.</text>
      <text>The Applicant may request, in writing, an exemption if (1) the relocation assistance required exceeds the reasonable costs of relocation for displaced mobilehome park residents, as prescribed by Government Code Section 65863.7(e); or (2) if, as part of bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy court has taken action that would prohibit or preclude the payment of relocation assistance benefits, in whole or in part; or (3) if the relocation assistance required would eliminate all or substantially all reasonable economic value of the property for alternate uses.</text>
      <text>Any request for exemption shall contain at a minimum, the following information:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>Statements of profit and loss from operations of the mobilehome park for the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the Application for exemption, certified by a certified public accountant. All such statements shall be maintained in confidence to the extent permitted by the California Public Records Act.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>An estimate of the total cost of relocation assistance which would be required in compliance with Section 5.156.090. This estimate shall be based on surveys, appraisals, and reports that document the number of residents of the park who are able to relocate their mobilehomes and those who would sell their mobilehomes, and the costs related to providing the relocation assistance, as otherwise required under Section 5.156.090.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>If the Applicant contends that continued use of the property as a mobilehome park necessitates repairs and/or improvements that are not the result of the park owner or Applicant's negligence or failure to properly maintain such property, and that the costs thereof make continuation of the mobilehome park economically infeasible, then the report shall include a report by a civil engineer or Licensed general contractor outlining such costs.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(d)</num>
        <text>If the proposed closure is due to conversion of the land to another use, an estimate of the value of the mobilehome park, an estimate of the value as is, and estimate of value after the change shall be provided. These estimates shall be prepared by a certified real estate appraiser.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(e)</num>
        <text>Any request for exemption filed pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding shall be accompanied by adequate documentation regarding the case name, case number, and court in which the bankruptcy proceeding is pending, and copies of all pertinent judgments, orders and decrees of the said court.</text>
      </para>
      <text>In determining whether to waive or modify a portion or all of any type of benefit that would otherwise be due under this ordinance, the Planning Commission may take into account the financial history of the mobilehome park, its condition and the condition of the amenities and improvements thereon, the cost of any necessary repairs, improvements, or rehabilitation of said park, the estimated costs of relocation, the fair market value of the property for any proposed alternative use, the fair market value of the property for continued use as a mobilehome park, and any other pertinent evidence requested or presented. The Planning Commission shall expressly indicate in its decision any waiver and the extent thereof and the reason therefore. The Planning Commission determination is subject to appeal by the parties and process indicated in Section 5.156.110.</text>
