        <heading>Purpose.</heading>
        <text>The County of San Mateo has a paramount interest in protecting the integrity of its governmental institutions, and to ensure that County government serves the best interests of the citizens of San Mateo County. Government Code section 25303 provides that the Board of Supervisors shall supervise the official conduct of all County officers, including elected officials, and additionally provides that the Board shall see that County officers faithfully perform their duties.</text>
        <text>County elected officials are elected by the people of San Mateo County, and are accountable in the first instance to the people. Nevertheless, the Board's obligation to oversee the official conduct of elected County officials may, in the case of well-founded allegations of serious official misconduct, require that the Board take action in response to such allegations. In carrying out its oversight responsibilities, the Board must be mindful that it does not interfere with the constitutional or statutory responsibilities invested in the County's elected officials.</text>
        <text>To further the Board's interest in protecting the integrity of its governmental institutions and to ensure that County government serves the best interest of its citizens, <cite path="2.04">this chapter</cite> will set forth a process to guide the Board, as well as other County elected officials, when investigating allegations of serious misconduct of County elected officials. This process shall be in addition to any other authority the Board of Supervisors may have to carry out its supervisory responsibilities under Government Code section 25303.</text>

        <text>Any Board member may refer to the Board an allegation or allegations of misconduct by an elected County official.

        <heading>Purpose.</heading>
        <text>The County of San Mateo has a paramount interest in protecting the health and safety of the public and in providing the highest standard of health care. To further this interest, County employees and contractors who perform health care services at County-operated health care facilities should be encouraged to report to their supervisor adverse events in health care facilities operated by the County. Members of the public also should be encouraged to report adverse events occurring in the hospital or its clinics to San Mateo Medical Center's Quality Management and to report adverse events occurring at all other County-operated health care facilities, labs or clinics to the Director of the Health System.</text>
        <text>This ordinance describes the kinds of adverse events that should be reported and sets forth the reporting and investigative process to be followed. These reports and investigations shall be done in such a manner as to not violate state or federal laws regulating the privacy of protected health care information and are in addition to any other statutory reporting requirements.</text>
        <text>This ordinance also protects all those employees who make such reports from retaliation from reporting the event or providing information about the event.</text>

        <heading>Repayment of aid.</heading>
        <text>Procedures for securing repayment of aid shall be established to implement the statutes contained in the Welfare and Institutions Code. San Mateo County may require recipients of adult general assistance, as a condition of aid, to sign an agreement to reimburse the County for aid advanced. An adult general assistance recipient may be required to execute a lien on any real property, owned or acquired by said recipient, to secure the repayment of monies expended by the County for the recipient's support. The Director of the Human Services Agency shall adopt a scale for determining the amount of repayment required, based on the following factors:</text>
        <para>
          <num>1.</num>
          <text>Amount of the account or sums due the County;</text>

          <text>Liabilities and responsibilities of the debtor.</text>
        </para>
        <text>Such liens may not be enforced during the life of the recipient, unless the property securing same is sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed of, but any income from such property shall be applied to the cost of said aid. In those cases in which the recipient is survived by a dependent spouse or child, the lien may not be enforced until the death of that spouse or child, or until such time as said spouse or dependant child has achieved self-maintenance, or until the property is sold, conveyed, or otherwise disposed of.</text>

        <text>It is the intent of this section to make possible the substitution of rehabilitative and constructive labor for confinement in the County Jail in order that those individuals who are convicted of public offenses and deprived of their liberty may become better citizens through such rehabilitative and constructive work experiences. Accordingly, all offenders confined to the adult correctional facilities of San Mateo County who are by State law permitted to engage in such work effort may be required by the Sheriff to work on public property or works for the benefit of the public. Any inmate of said facilities who appears physically or mentally unable to perform such work without impairment of his mental or physical health, at the time of classification, shall be referred to the jail physician. All inmates ordered to work on public property or works as herein provided shall, at all times while engaged in such activity, be and work under the direct supervision of a Deputy Sheriff, or under the direct supervision of a person deputized by the Sheriff to perform such supervision, and all work to be done must be at the direction of the public body having jurisdiction over the property or public work whereon the work is being performed. The number of prisoners assigned to any given task shall be by agreement of the Sheriff and the Director of the agency having jurisdiction over the property or public work whereon such task is being performed. The Sheriff shall be directly responsible for the custody and safekeeping of inmates so engaged in such tasks, and for the protection of the public in connection with the activities contemplated hereunder.</text>

        <heading>Purpose.</heading>
        <text>Many individuals have made significant contributions to the citizens of the County of San Mateo through their work, their civic involvement, or through their monetary or other donations to the County and to foundations which provide support to County programs. It has been the County's policy to recognize and honor such contributions when appropriate to do so. One method of recognizing significant contributions to the County is through the naming of County facilities in honor of the individual for his or her contribution.</text>
        <text>It is the intent of the Board that the naming of a County facility only occurs in exceptional circumstances, taking into account the time period over which any contribution is made, the number of people affected by the contribution, and the extent to which the County's population has been affected to the better by the actions of the individual proposed for recognition.</text>

          <text>There is a need to finance a Countywide program to reconstruct existing public roads which have suffered deterioration to the extent that operational aspects of the road are in danger of becoming impaired, to upgrade existing public roads to meet the additional burden caused by increased development and to establish a mechanism to finance drainage facility improvements in easements that are reaching the end of their serviceable life.</text>

        <text>The Board of Supervisors has further determined that there is a reasonable relationship between the roadway and drainage facilities and improvements which will be financed with fees collected, and the development projects upon which the fees will be imposed, in that additional development will lead to an increased use of the road and drainage facilities with the consequential additional burden on the road and drainage facilities. Accordingly, the following fees and charges are established.</text>

        <text>Applicants for building permits and subdivision approvals required to pay fees under <cite path="2.53">this chapter</cite> may, as an alternative to paying the fee, offer to construct road improvements determined by the Director of Public Works to be appropriate for the type of development being proposed. In making such determination, the Public Works Director shall take into consideration the extent to which the proposed improvements would be consistent with the existing road improvements in the immediate vicinity, and the extent to which the road improvements would either improve or impair the operational characteristics of the public road if installed immediately. In exchange for such offer, the applicant shall receive a partial or full offset of the fee which would otherwise be required.</text>

        <text>There is in the County a Planning Commission consisting of five members, who shall not be officials or employees of the County of San Mateo. The five members shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Supervisors. One member shall reside in each supervisorial district and members shall reside in the district of their appointment during their term. These residency requirements may be waived by the Board of Supervisors if it finds such waiver to be in the public interest. In the event that the Board of Supervisors waives the requirement that one member reside in each supervisorial district, reasonable effort shall be made to seek appointees from areas as geographically near as practicable to the district that lacks a resident member. However, in no event shall more than two (2) members reside in the same supervisorial district.</text>
        <text>The term of office for each member shall be four years. The term for a member shall coincide with the term of office of the Supervisor representing the member's district of appointment. When a Supervisor vacates office for any reason, the term of the member appointed from the same district shall also be vacated, except that said member may continue in office until a successor is appointed by the Board of Supervisors. Members are limited to three consecutive full terms of office. For purposes of determining the number of consecutive terms that a member may serve, any person appointed to fill a vacancy on the Commission will be considered to have served a full term if there are two or more years remaining in the term to which appointed, determined as of the date of appointment to fill the vacancy; and any person appointed to fill a vacancy on the Commission with less than two years remaining in the term as of the date of appointment will not be considered to have served a full term.</text>

        <heading>Benefits for employees of an agency whose functions are assumed by the County.</heading>
        <text>Whenever the functions of another public agency, or of a private agency performing functions on behalf of the County, are assumed by the County and, as a part of said assumption of functions, some or all of the employees of the agency are subsequently employed by the County to perform the same or similar functions, the unused vacation allowances and sick leave benefits accumulated by such employees in their prior employment, as of the date of their entry into County service, may at the discretion of the County Manager, be credited to each of those employees; provided, however, that no employee may be credited with vacation allowances or sick leave benefits over and above those which would have accumulated had he been employed by the County rather than by the agency. Also, such benefits may be granted only at the time that such employee initially enters County Service. Prior service as an employee of such an agency may, at the discretion of the County Manager, be credited in determining the rate of accrual eligibility for County vacation allowances and sick leave benefits.</text>
        <text>The provisions of this section shall be applicable to employees of such an agency only if the agency pays to the County the cost, based on pay at the time of entry into County service, of providing such vacation allowances and sick leave benefits accumulated by such employees during their prior employment by such an agency.</text>

        <heading>Changes in compensation for elected department heads.</heading>
        <text>In November of each year, the County Manager shall determine the salaries of elected department heads for the succeeding year by determining the percentage increase granted to non-elected department heads as set forth in the resolution expressing the compensation and benefits of unrepresented management personnel and applying the same percentage increase to the salaries of the elected department heads. Equity adjustments or special compensation granted to individual non-elected department heads shall not be included in the calculation of the percentage increase. The County Manager shall notify the members of the Board of Supervisors and the elected department heads of the new annual compensation by December 1st of each year and the Controller is hereby directed to pay, beginning January 1st, the new compensation as determined by the County Manager in accordance with this section.</text>
        <text>Within 90 days prior to the commencement of the candidacy filing period for the election of County elected department heads, the Board of Supervisors shall determine the annual salary for these department head positions for the start of the next succeeding term.</text>
        <text>The Board of Supervisors retains the authority to make whatever other salary and benefit adjustments for elected department heads as it shall, in its sole discretion, determine.</text>

        <text>Whenever elected offices are changed to appointed offices and the officer holding such elective office is employed by the County to perform the same or similar functions, without interruption of service to the County, any unused or unpaid vacation allowances, sick leave benefits and military leave benefits accumulated by such an officer in prior employment, either in County service prior to election or during service in the elective office, shall continue and shall be added to the vacation allowances, sick leave benefits, and military leave benefits which such officer earns in the appointed position. All prior service, including elective service, shall be given credit in determining accumulation rates for County vacation allowances, sick leave benefits and military leave benefits.</text>

The granting of any leave of absence shall be based on the presumption that the employee intends to return to work upon the expiration of the leave. The cost of the provision of benefits during any leave may be recovered if the employee fails to return from leave after the period of leave and the employee's failure to return from leave is for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that entitles the employee to leave or other circumstances beyond the control of the employee.</text>

If disciplinary action is not taken on or before the date such leave is terminated, the leave shall be with pay. If disciplinary action is taken on or before the date such leave is terminated, the disciplinary action may be specified to be retroactive to any date on or after the date the employee or officer went on leave. If disciplinary action is retroactive to a date later than the date the employee or officer went on leave, the leave prior to the effective date of the disciplinary action shall be with pay. If the disciplinary action consists of a reprimand and no more the leave shall be with pay.</text>
        <text>As used in this section, "disciplinary action" means dismissal, demotion, suspension without pay, or reprimand.</text>
        <text>In any case where the hiring or dismissal of an employee or officer requires the approval of any other officer, board or commission, in addition to the appointing officer, no disciplinary action shall be taken against such employee or officer without the approval that would have been required for his hiring or dismissal.</text>

Bids may be solicited, submitted, opened, and reported electronically via the County website or similar publicly accessible portal. If articles of personal property are referred to by a specific mark or brand name, the Purchasing Agent shall give notice in the solicitation that articles of equal value, utility or merit, which, in the opinion of the County, meet the salient characteristics of the original specification will be considered.

        <text>At the beginning of every month the County Recorder shall report to the County Controller the amounts of taxes collected during the preceding month pursuant to <cite path="2.93">this chapter</cite> and each such city ordinance. Where the deed, instrument or writing presented for recordation describes real property which lies between two cities or between a city and an unincorporated area, the recorder may hold the transfer tax proceeds in suspense for a reasonable period of time in order to determine an appropriate division, but the report to the County Controller shall include the amount of such proceeds held in suspense. On or about the twentieth (20th) day of each month the Controller shall allocate and distribute the previous month's taxes based on the report and request for disbursement of the County Recorder, as follows:</text>

        <text>The Recorder shall not record any deed, instrument or writing subject to the tax imposed pursuant to <cite path="2.93">this chapter</cite> unless the tax is paid at the time of recording.</text>
        <text>A declaration of the amount of the tax due, signed by the party determining the tax or his agent, shall appear on the face of every document subject to the tax hereunder which is submitted for recordation, or if the party submitting the document for recordation so requests, the declaration may be placed on a separate paper. The Recorder may rely on the declaration; provided he has no reason to believe that the full amount of the tax due has not been paid. The declaration shall include a statement that the consideration or value on which the tax due was computed, was, or that it was not, exclusive of the value of a lien or encumbrance remaining on the interest or property conveyed at the time of sale.</text>
        <text>If the party submitting the document for recordation has requested that the declaration be placed upon a separate paper, the separate paper shall be affixed to the document by the Recorder after the permanent record is made and before the original is returned as specified in section 27321 of the Government Code.</text>
        <text>In the case of any deed, instrument or writing relating to real property which lies partially in the County of San Mateo and partially in a neighboring County, the declaration shall state the amount of the tax imposed by <cite path="2.93">this chapter</cite> attributable to that portion of the property within the County of San Mateo, and the County Recorder shall record the document upon payment of that portion of the tax due as stated in the declaration. The amount of the tax stated in the declaration shall be based upon the ratio between that portion of the property within the County of San Mateo to the entire parcel of real property to be conveyed pursuant to the document involved. An affidavit may be required by the County Recorder as to the portion of the tax attributable to the real property involved which is situated in the County of San Mateo.</text>
        <text>Every document subject to tax hereunder which is submitted for recordation shall show on the face of the document the location of the lands, tenements or other realty described in the document. If said lands, tenements or other realty are located within a city in the County of San Mateo, the name of that city shall be set forth.
