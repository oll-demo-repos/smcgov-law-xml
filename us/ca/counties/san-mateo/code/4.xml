      <text>Upon application of a user, and upon a finding by the Director of Public Works that a significant portion of freshwater or non-wastewater, received by the user from any metered source does not flow into the sewerage facilities because of the principal activity of the user, or by reason of removal of wastewater by other means, the Director of Public Works may authorize determination of the volume of wastewater discharge to be made by an appropriate metering device. Upon such determination by the Director of Public Works, a metering device, of a type approved by the Director of Public Works, and at a location approved by the Director of Public Works, shall be installed at the user's expense. Such metering device shall measure either the amount of wastewater discharged into the sewerage facilities, or the amount of freshwater or non-wastewater diverted from the sewerage facilities. Upon installation, such meters shall be maintained and tested periodically for accuracy in accordance with requirements established by the Director of Public Works, all of which maintenance and testing shall be at the expense of the user.</text>

The determination of such estimated wastewater volume shall be based upon such factors as the number of fixtures through which wastewater flows into the sewerage facilities from the user's premises, seating capacity of buildings or improvements upon the premises, the population equivalent associated with the premises, annual production of goods and services related to the premises, or other factors reasonably relating to water use, wastewater volume calculations, and/or diversions of wastewater flow from the sewerage facilities.</text>

      <text>Pretreatment of wastes or wastewater shall be furnished by every user on the user's premises when such waste or wastewater, prior to pretreatment does not comply with the minimum acceptable requirements and criteria therefor for discharge into the sewerage facilities as set forth in sections <cite path="4.28.030" proof="needed">4.28.030</cite> through <cite path="4.28.130" proof="needed">4.28.130</cite> of <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>. Such pretreatment facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense, and shall be of sufficient design and capacity to pretreat waste or wastewater discharged from the premises into the sewerage facilities to a level meeting such minimum requirements, and such other requirements established by the Director of Public Works and reasonably necessary or appropriate for the sewerage facilities to treat adequately such waste or wastewater under normal operating and treatment conditions.</text>
      <text>Prior to the installation of such pretreatment facilities, plans and specifications therefor shall be submitted to the Director of Public Works, together with such data and descriptive material relating to the waste or wastewater prior to, and after such proposed pretreatment as the Director of Public Works may require, in order that the Director of Public Works may ascertain the wastewater constituents and characteristics and volume of the wastewater discharge after pretreatment. The user shall make such modifications, changes or amendments to said plans and specifications as the Director of Public Works may reasonably require in order that the provisions of <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>, or any permit issued, or to be issued pursuant to <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>, shall be complied with.

      <text>Approval of plans and specifications of pretreatment facilities pursuant to this section shall not relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such pretreatment facilities as necessary to produce effluent therefrom complying with all pertinent provisions of <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>, or any permit issued pursuant to <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>, or any other requirements of law. Any proposed cessation of use, or alteration, modification or other change to approved pretreatment facilities or any portion thereof, or any change in method of operation thereof, shall be reported to the Director of Public Works prior to commencement thereof, and shall be subject to the approval of the Director of Public Works. Such approval may be withheld, granted, or granted subject to such terms, conditions, or requirements as the Director of Public Works may reasonably require in order to ensure compliance with the provisions of <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>, or any permit issued pursuant to the provisions of <cite path="4.28" proof="needed">this chapter</cite>.</text>

        <text>Residential Unit Equivalent. A residential unit equivalent shall be defined as the estimated number of residential units that would equal the sewage flow, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) loading delivered to the sanitary sewer system by commercial or industrial customers. For the purpose of <cite path="4.32" proof="needed">this chapter</cite> of the code, all parcels of property not classified as in paragraph (f) above, shall be charged for sewage service on the basis of residential unit equivalents. To determine the number of residential unit equivalents for flow (V1/VR) the metered or estimated volume of domestic water, in gallons, delivered to a parcel for a twelve (12) consecutive month period is divided by the product of two hundred twenty (220) gal/day times three hundred sixty-five (365) days. The number of residential unit equivalents for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) shall be determined by dividing the metered rate or district assigned rate by two hundred seventy-five (275) mg/l (BOD) and three hundred (300) mg/l (SS) respectively. Upon proper application and substantiation by the owner of the parcel, the Director of Public Works may modify the number of residential unit equivalents so calculated due to the fact that a substantial amount of the domestic water delivered to the parcel does not enter the sanitary sewer system. For the purpose of <cite path="4.32" proof="needed">this chapter</cite> of the code, the residential unit equivalents (flow, BOD and SS) shall be utilized as indicated in <cite path="4.32.020" proof="needed">section 4.32.020</cite> to determine the charge for sewage services for parcels identified as commercial and industrial.</text>

      <heading>Purpose.</heading>
      <text>This ordinance is intended to promote reasonable conservation of water in the County of San Mateo consistent with maintaining a comfortable standard of living and a healthy economy. It provides a framework for the orderly and timely implementation of reasonable water conservation measures by the different elements of the County's economy. This ordinance also carries out certain provisions of the Water Code of the State of California as embodied in article XIV, section 3 of the Constitution of the State of California which states that maximum beneficial use of the water resources of the State is necessary to prevent the waste or unreasonable use, or unreasonable method of use, of water. This ordinance further implements the provisions of the Conservation Element of the Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan for San Mateo County as adopted on June 20, 1978.</text>
      <text>It is recognized that stricter water conservation measures may be necessary during a future drought or water shortage emergency. Such further measures should not penalize water users for past conservation practices, nor should implementation of water conservation measures constitute a new basis to determine future reduction in case of a declared water shortage emergency. No provision in this ordinance is intended to supersede any rule or regulation of the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California.</text>

      <text>An economically feasible recirculation installation is defined as, over the useful life of the equipment to be installed, a system where the present worth of the cost of the water saved is more than the present worth of both the capital, and the annual operation and maintenance costs. Such economic and technical feasibility shall be prepared by the user with the determination of feasibility made by the County Building Official.</text>

      <text>Notwithstanding the foregoing relating to conservation of water supplies, it is apparent that in times of a declared water shortage emergency pursuant to section 350, et seq. of the Water Code of the State of California, certain additional mandatory water conservation practices will be necessary. It is the intent of this ordinance that after allocating and setting aside the amount of water which in the opinion of the governing body will be necessary to supply water needed for domestic use, sanitation, and fire protection, the emergency regulations shall establish priorities in the use of water for other purposes and shall provide for the allocation, distribution, and delivery of water for such other purposes, without discrimination between consumers using water for the same purpose or purposes. Regulations so adopted shall not penalize water users for past conservation practices.</text>

      <heading>Application to wells in the Westside Basin Aquifer.</heading>
      <text>Before issuing any permit under <cite path="4.68.080" proof="needed">Section 4.68.080</cite> for the construction of a large well, as defined below, that proposes to draw water from the Westside Basin Aquifer, the County Health Officer may consider whether the granting of the permit would result in special circumstances which may present a threat of harm to the health, safety or welfare of persons or the environment. If the County Health Officer determines that special circumstances exist which present a threat of harm to the health, safety or welfare of persons or the environment, the County Health Officer may deny such permit or grant such permit with conditions designed to eliminate such threats. "Special circumstances," for purposes of this section, shall include, but not be limited to:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>A well in an area that is subject to a specific and localized groundwater problem; or</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>A well which presents a potential of overdraft of an aquifer.</text>
      </para>
      <text>Notwithstanding <cite path="4.68.320" proof="needed">Section 4.68.320</cite> ("Variances"), the County Health Officer may authorize alternative specifications in granting a permit with conditions under <cite path="4.68" proof="needed">this chapter</cite> where he finds that such alternative specifications or means provide protection to the well equivalent to that provided otherwise under the requirements of the chapter.</text>
      <text>The County Health Officer may take necessary action, including the denial, revocation or suspension of a well permit for a large well that proposes to draw water from the Westside Basin Aquifer in order to avoid pollution or contamination of water resources and to protect the public health and safety.</text>
      <text>For purposes of this section, a "large well" means any individual well that pumps an amount equal to or greater than 50 gallons per minute or 1,000 gallons per day, or multiple small wells on the same land use parcel which cumulatively pump an amount equal to or greater than 50 gallons per minute or 1,000 gallons per day. This includes wells used for public parks, cemeteries and golf courses. It excludes wells for residential use, temporary construction, cathodic protection, geophysical exploration/monitoring wells, and wells required in an emergency situation for drinking water purposes. An "emergency" means a sudden, unexpected occurrence demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss or damage to life, health, property or essential public services. The "Westside Basin Aquifer" means the aquifer occurring in the area south of the San Mateo/San Francisco border, east of the San Andreas Fault and north of Burlingame/San Mateo City borders as defined by maps on file with County Environmental Health Division.</text>

      <heading>Tests of backflow prevention assemblies.</heading>
      <text>All testable backflow prevention assemblies, including but not limited to double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies, reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assemblies, reduced pressure principle detector assemblies, pressure vacuum breaker backsiphonage prevention assemblies, and spill-resistant pressure vacuum breaker backsiphonage prevention assemblies which have been installed to meet the requirements of <cite path="17" proof="needed">Title 17</cite> of the California Code of Regulations and <cite path="4.72" proof="needed">this chapter</cite> shall be tested when initially installed and at least once each year thereafter. The annual re-test must occur within thirty (30) days of the established anniversary date for the assembly, but never less than once every 395 days, by a person certified pursuant to <cite path="4.72.080" proof="needed">section 4.72.080</cite> of this chapter. Records of such tests shall be filed with Environmental Health within ten (10) days after such tests. Records shall be on forms provided by, or by mechanism specified by Environmental Health, or on a similar form that includes all the same equivalent data as determined by Environmental Health.</text>
      <text>Testable backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested using current USC test procedures as recognized by Environmental Health. When a backflow prevention assembly is inspected and has passed the testing procedure, the certified tester shall immediately affix a numbered inspection tag to the assembly. When a backflow prevention assembly fails the testing procedure, the certified tester shall immediately affix a "failed" inspection tag to the assembly. Records of failed assembly tests shall be filed with Environmental Health within ten (10) days. The "failed" inspection tag shall remain affixed to the assembly until the assembly is repaired, has passed the testing procedures and has been affixed with a numbered inspection tag. Pursuant to section 116875 of California Health and Safety Code, any failed assembly that is not "lead free", that is not specifically exempted by section 116875, must be replaced with an approved "lead free" assembly rather than being repaired.</text>

      <heading>Variances—Procedure.</heading>
      <text>Any person seeking a variance for a noise source which the Health Officer has determined violates any provision of this ordinance may file an application with the Noise Board of Review Secretary. Said application shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of Fifty Dollars ($50.00). The application shall contain information that demonstrates that bringing the noise source into compliance with this ordinance would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, the community, or on other persons. The applicant shall also set forth any actions already taken to comply with the provisions of this ordinance. A separate application shall be filed for each noise source; provided, however, that several mobile sources operating within the boundaries of a single property may be combined into one application. Notice of an application for a variance shall be published (according to established jurisdictional procedure). Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by the allowance of the variance may file a statement with the Noise Board of Review containing any information to support his/her claim.</text>
      <text>Upon receipt of the application and all supporting evidence deemed necessary by the Noise Board of Review, the Board shall within (30) days, (1) approve the application in whole or in part, or (2) deny the application.</text>
      <text>Applicants for variances and persons contesting variances may be required to submit such information as the Board may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the Board Secretary shall keep on public file a copy of the decision and the reason for granting or denying the variance.</text>

      <text>It is the intent of this ordinance to protect the public health and safety and enhance water quality while respecting the rights of private property owners to economically viable use of land. It is not the intent of this ordinance to prohibit all economically viable use of private lands, nor to result in a confiscatory impact. Accordingly, the purpose of this section is to provide for an administrative procedure for a waiver or modification of a particular provision of this ordinance in the event that the strict application of this ordinance would result in the denial of all economically viable use of real property.</text>
      <text>An applicant for a waiver of a provision of this ordinance shall file a waiver application with the Director of the Division of Environmental Health on a form provided by the Director identifying the provision sought to be waived or modified. The applicant shall file a complete form and shall provide all documentation and information required by the Director to determine whether application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have a confiscatory impact.</text>
      <text>The Director may approve, deny or conditionally approve a waiver application upon determining whether the application of the provision in question will prohibit any economically viable use of the land in question or otherwise have a confiscatory result and that approval of such a waiver will not result in a public nuisance which would constitute a direct threat to the public health or safety.</text>
